      <p>Award-winning investigative journalist.</p>
      <p>I’m a platypus — as a denizen of plucky newsrooms, I’ve taught myself a wide range of complimentary skills like photography, data analysis and visualization, print layout and project managment.</p>
      <p>That makes me a key member for a team that’s trying to punch up and innovate.</p>

      <p>Tenants alleged that Veritas Investments Inc., perhaps the largest rent-control landlord in San Francisco, neglected their needs while fostering inhospitable living environments through perennial, on-site construction projects — with the goal of pushing tenants out and charging newcomers higher rents. The company vigorously denied the claims.</p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="hideme">In my story, I created a custom database from various public records, proving that building-code violations increased after the company bought the properties. This appeared to lend credence to the tenants’ narrative.</span></p>

      <p>My analysis of Veritas properties drew public data from multiple sources, synthesizing them into a single data set that allowed me to spot trends.</p>

      <p>In late 2018, California voters prepared to weigh in on a controversial ballot measure that could strengthen local rent-control policies.</p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="hideme">I dissected a form of rent control that would become legal if the state measure passed, and that had potential to appease warring political camps dramatically growing the stock of price-controlled housing.</span></p>

      <br>
      <p><span class="hideme">But my data analysis proved that the centers’ clients were increasingly returning to the streets, and the largest subset of clients received bus rides out of town.</span></p>

      <p>Years prior, city officials had commissioned a study to estimate how many, and which, apartment buildings were vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake. But they never publicized the findings.</p> 
      <br>
      <p><span class="hideme">When I did, the resulting web traffic overloaded our site for days. Within months, the city had created a program to compel those building owners to retrofit.</span></p>

        <p>Folders and files were stored all over the place: In various team members’ personal hard drives or cloud-storage accounts. Files were unnecessarily lost or duplicated ― <em>often.</em></p>
